# Live2D Web Display

## Based on [Live2D Cubism SDK for Web](https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/download-web/)
 - Live2DCubismCore
 - [CubismWebFramework](https://github.com/Live2D/CubismWebFramework)

Same as [CubismWebSamples](https://github.com/Live2D/CubismWebSamples), both are application-layer projects (see more details on [Cubism SDK Manual](https://docs.live2d.com/en/cubism-sdk-manual/cubism-core-api-reference/)).

It decoupled user custom code from management code, so it also could be used as a application framework.
